# Coursera-Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning
- VIT provided one free _Coursera_ course so I chose this one.
- I will also be keeping my notes here for the most important stuff I will learn.

# The course
- This course is only the 1st in a series of 5 courses(called a [specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) by coursera) which are:
	1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning
	2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
	3. Structuring your Machine Learning project
	4. Convolutional Neural Networks
	5. Natural Language Processing: Building sequence models
- At the end of this course, a neural network which can recognize cats (yes!!) will be created.
