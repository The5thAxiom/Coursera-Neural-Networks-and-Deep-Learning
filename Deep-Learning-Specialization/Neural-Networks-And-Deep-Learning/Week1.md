# Introduction to Deep Learning
## What is a Neural Network
- A network of _neurons_ which basically do fancy regression and produce an output.
- For example, predicting the price of a house from many variables like the size, the number of bedrooms, the zip code and the wealth of the area.
- The NN figures out on its own how to use each variable (instead of us manually telling it what determines what).
## Supervised Learning with Neural Networks
- All currently working NNs(for eg: ad tracking, image recognition, audio transcribing, text translation, self driving) use _supervised learning_.
- A data in a table or db is called structured data.
- Data like images, audio, text is called unstructured data.
- Humans are good with unstructured data and computers are usually good with structured data, NNs are so cool because they can be good with unstructured data.
## Why is Deep Learning Taking off?
- Deep learning has been working well for only a few years.
- It was shit until then because the performance of data was shit. It was too much data for potato computers.
- Also, the amount of data has been sufficient only after digitization.
- Now, we both have data and power(3090 ftw) to properly use deep learning.
- More recently, algorithms have been driving growth of NNs rather than the pure scale of power and data.
- For example, now we are using ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) functions instead of sigmoid functions.
