# Functional Programming Principles in Scala
- How I enrolled: the name looked interesting, so I clicked the 'go to course' button and the site enrolled me!! XD
- But, now that I am enrolled, I am gonna do it!
- I have minimal experience with Scala and do have the software needed to run it, so lets see how this goes!!
- Also, iirc, Scala compiles to bitcode and is JVM compatible. This, combined with the Java Programming course I have in college will make quite a pair I think!
