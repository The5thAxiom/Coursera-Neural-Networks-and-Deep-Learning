# Getting Started
## Coures Introduction
- Scala is very popular in the functional programming world.
- Works well with OOP stuff (as it comiples to JVM iirc)

## Working on Assignments
- Always take the graded assignments (which don't say 'practice' or 'audit version')

## Tools Setup
- jvm and sbt
- i have the jdk
- and reinstalled sbt
- this is the worst part of starting any new programming language, the complete hell of setting it up
- use powershell to use sbt (i think git bash is causing some issues)

# Functions & Evaluation
## Programming Paradigms
- Scala is a functional programming language
- Forget what you know and jump into functional programming head-on
## Elements of Programming
- Scala REPL (read, eval, print loop) is started by typing `sbt console` (`scala` works if that is installed but i only have sbt rn)
