# Coursera-Notes
- This is a repo for my notes made while watching lectures on Coursera.
- Some of the markdown files (.md) will include latex-style inline formulas, which github doesn't support. Please use a markdon viewer that does (like vscode).
- I have not included any answers for the programming assignments for any course. This repo only has notes typed by me(but following what the instructor said).
- I won't provide any answers for any assignments.
