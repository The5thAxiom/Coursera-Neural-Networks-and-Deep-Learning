# Coursera-Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning
- A repo for the course work done for the Coursera 'Neural Networks and Deep Learning' course by DeepLearning AI.
- VIT provided one free _Coursera_ course so I chose this one.
- This repo will hold any programming or adjacent work done in the course.
- I will also be keeping my notes here for the most important stuff I will learn.
>NOTE: This repo will not contain any answers for programming assignments, but just my notes, any work done while following the videos and my own implementations of some stuff.
>ANOTHER NOTE: Some `.md` files contain inline equations (in the LATEX format), you might have to use a mardown viewer which supports it (vscode is good for that).

# The course
- This course is only the 1st in a series of 5 courses which are:
	1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning
	2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
	3. Structuring your Machine Learning project
	4. Convolutional Neural Networks
	5. Natural Language Processing: Building sequence models
- At the end of this course, a neural network which can recognize cats (yes!!) will be created.
