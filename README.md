A repo for the course work done for the Coursera 'Neural Networks and Deep Learning' course by DeepLearning AI.
# About
- VIT provided one free _Coursera_ course so I chose this one.
- This repo will hold any programming or adjacent work done in the course.
- I will also be keeping my notes here for the most important stuff I will learn.
